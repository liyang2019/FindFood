# FindFood

A Find Restaurant app using Object-C.

• Developed an iOS app for users to search restaurants by keywords using Yelp API, AFNetworking, and Cocoapod.

• Used a tab bar to show searched results on restaurants view and pin their locations on the map view.

• Implemented a networking module using the singleton pattern. Implemented the fetching-restaurants-based-on-location method asynchronously with completion blocks.

• Used a TableView with multiple prototype cells to show the details of a search restaurant including name, stars, reviews, price level, map locations and other information.
